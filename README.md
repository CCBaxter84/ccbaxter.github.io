This project is my portfolio of projects I have created. 

I created this application using React.js. It is organized into functional components as .js files and associated .css files for each component. The component files are located in the 'components' folder, which is located in the 'src' folder.

I didn't have a need to use any state management in this application. However, the AppsContainer component does pass props values to the AppTileCard components to render each of my projects and their associated information to the page.

For styling, I used plain CSS. I also used flexbox in several components.

For the projects displayed within this portfolio, I created a GIF of me using the site on flip cards. Consequently, the portfolio is a high-level view of each project being operated by a user. When you scroll over the GIF, the backside of the flip card comes to front and provides links that user can click to open the application or see its GitHub repository.
